9.2 Jailbreak using iOTrap as a kernel exploit.
Heap Overflow as an attack vector on code signatures.
And no untetherer. 
Please extract .zip I am done working on the jailbreak. 
One of my team members have left twitter, so I honestly am tired of doing this. 

Only made for iOS 9.2 | 64 bit 

todo
currently run.sh is broken. 
jailbreak.m is broken.
that's it. 

changelog
V.2 - offical version, in honor of how lazy I was when zipping the file on the first two days of creating the jailbreak. 

since this has been uploaded to github there have been no changes.
